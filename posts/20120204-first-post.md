Welcome to my new website! There is not much content on here yet but you can
have a look at an overview of some of [my personal projects](/projects/). I've also
written a tutorial on the basics of automated testing of web
browsers [using Selenium and Python](/2/running-tests-in-python-with-selenium-2-and-webdriver/).
