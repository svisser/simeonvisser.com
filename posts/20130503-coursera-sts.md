With [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and other online learning platforms gaining in popularity I
decided to give it a try as well with the course *Science, Technology, and
Society in China I: Basic Concepts* by [Naubahar Sharif](http://www.naubaharsharif.com)
of the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk).

### Why this course? ###

It is a very accessible course which defines and explains the concepts in a
clear way. It builds well upon my background
knowledge of the course *Philosophy of Computer Science* that I followed back
in the day at an actual university.

Prior to the course I was familiar
with the notions of falsification and paradigms (i.e., what constitutes science
and the methods of science) and I had a general
understanding of technology. But it turns out a lot more can be said
about the relationship between technology and science within society and how
that leads to innovations.

I picked this course because it would give me a better insight on technology
and innovation as viewed within a society, in particular a non-Western society
such as China. It also makes sense to study how innovations come about as there
are many developing societies that want to improve their ability to
innovate.

It is not uncommon to hear of new startups in Silicon Valley that
strive to "disrupt their market" or to refer to product features
as "innovations" when that is mostly a debatable opinion. In this light it is
interesting to learn that scholars have actually studied what innovations are, how
they occur and why doing the same thing in another country is also considered
innovative.

### On following an online course ###

Within hours of the start of the course there were already people asking in
the forums for clarification about the first assignment. These questions could
have easily been answered if you had actually viewed the lectures. At first I
thought this was part of typical internet drama: students unwilling to do
the work necessary to complete a course.

Based on the question's formulation that is still the most likely
explanation. However, it occurred to me that some people may not have
an adequate internet connection to view the lecture videos as in most
Western countries. For me this course is mostly intellectual curiosity but
for others it makes sense to take this course to improve their business
relationships with China by having a better understanding of their society.

If it takes an evening to download each lecture then it makes sense to
ask for the correct video in the course forums right away (i.e., the lecture
video that explained the concepts mentioned in the assignment).
Nonetheless I was happy to see the bar being raised for the second and third
assignments to make sure decent efforts are put into completing the course.

### Summary ###

I have just completed my peer evaluations which ticks the final box towards
completing the course. It's difficult to assess your own submissions, especially
when it's far more subjective than assignments given in most beta sciences, but
I think I'll pass the course.

Perhaps the most striking example of innovation in this context is that online
higher-education courses make university-level lectures freely available to
anyone worldwide. Speaking in academic terms, the question of whether that
is a "disruptive innovation" is left as an excercise for the reader.
