After [preparing for the Four Days Marches Nijmegen 2013](/posts/participating-in-the-international-four-days-marches-nijmegen.html)
it makes sense to share some observations after completing the event a
few weeks ago. The short story is that walking 200km in four days can be done,
it's a fun event to participate in but it can also be painful at times.

The event combines friendly people, typical Dutch music and marching military forces
into a fun spectacle with its ups and downs along the way. The blisters haven't
fully healed yet but I made it to the finish line so here's the story.

This year's edition was characterised by hot weather which implies a lot of
sweating and drinking water to stay hydrated. Fortunately this is easier to live
with than a day of heavy rain which will pretty much guarantee blisters.
In my case it didn't make much difference as I had six blisters by the end of
the event. I learned that blister plasters can work like magic and they
allowed me to continue walking.

### Preparation ###

The organizers of the event are keen to emphasize that this is not a casual
walk but an event that requires serious preparation to discourage people from
signing up willy-nilly.

I didn't really prepare for fifty kilometers of walking as that is about ten
hours (excluding breaks) of walking and it doesn't make sense to sacrifice
so much time when you can learn to adapt during the event itself. You would also
be walking that distance alone as few people are crazy enough to join you. The
longest distance I walked in preparation was about thirty to thirty-five kilometers
which I could do without pain and injuries so I thought I was ready to go.

On the first day you discover how far fifty kilometers is and on the
other three days you walk the same distance by pacing yourself better. I
made the classic beginner's mistake of walking too fast on the first day only
to realize that I now had two blisters which I'd have to endure on the remaining
days.

### Logistics ###

An unexpected challenge of the event is not just the walking but also the logistics
surrounding it. You have to get to and from the starting line
and you have to eat, shower and sleep all within 24 hours. There is plenty of
time to complete the walk each day but any time spent walking can't be
spent sleeping.

It would be great if
you could get dropped off a the starting line, walk fifty kilometers, and then get
picked up afterwards. Alas, that isn't the case and this combination of factors
means the fifty kilometers on the second and third day weigh on you differently
than on the first day. I have to say that walking fifty kilometers isn't that
difficult but it's a different story when it's done on four consecutive days.

There is plenty of food to purchase along the way and there are also people
handing out free fruit and other stuff, such as candy and liquorice. You can
bring your own food but I've also seen people having their breakfast at the
first possible break (e.g., a bakery with extended opening hours).

### The event ###

A person I talked to during the event, who had completed it numerous times,
summed it up quite nicely. There are two events simultaneously taking place in
the city of Nijmegen: one event is the party in the bars and streets of the city
and the other event is created by the walkers and spectators alongside
the road. The walk itself is their party and the spectators enjoy themselves too
by watching and encouraging the walkers.

I can wholeheartedly recommend taking part in the event and I can see why some
people make this event one of their annual holidays.

To be fair, at my age the distance of fifty kilometers is mandatory and
practically it's much easier to prepare for fourty or thirty kilometers.
Having experienced the event this year
I'm not sure it makes sense to do it again next year with so many other events
out there. On the other hand, it has been said that the itch to participate
tends to occur next year when the application form is available online again.
So, we'll see what happens.
