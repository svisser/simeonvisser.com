About a month ago I uploaded a selection of my better travel photos to 500px.com
(see [my profile](http://500px.com/simeonvisser) there). It's far from my
entire photo collection but I thought it would be nice to put some online rather
than letting them collect digital dust on my hard drives.

It's also quite clear that a basic digital camera, some sunshine, decent
composition and nice scenery are no longer sufficient to produce a work of art.
My uploaded photos are indeed what they are: carefully selected holiday photos
but not masterfully edited works of art made with the finest equipment. I don't
have a trained eye for this but I do feel the ratio of edited versus unedited
photos is skewed towards the former.

My previous camera was the Samsung L370 and my current camera is the
somewhat better Coolpix S8200. I have to say I barely know more than the automatic
feature of the camera but I'm planning to remedy that in the future.
