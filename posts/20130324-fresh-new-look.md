Although it's late March and London hasn't quite shown what spring should
look like I thought it would be good to do some spring "cleaning" of my website.
That means saying goodbye to my homebuilt combination of PHP
and Markdown and saying hello to [Nikola](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/), a
static site generator written in Python.

As Nikola supports Markdown it was
fairly easy to convert my old website to this new setup. I can now focus on
writing the content and generate the whole website with a single command.
Some new features are the posts archive and the ability to tag posts.

The new theme is still quite [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)-y but at least it's one of the themes
(Readable) from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) rather than the
default Bootstrap theme.

I have configured the `.htaccess` file of the website so old links should
still work. If you have come across a link that doesn't work anymore please let me
know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/simeonvisser).
