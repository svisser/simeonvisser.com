I've updated this website today with a greatly simplified structure: all
writings are now organized by date on the homepage, with no
further distinction between blogs or tutorials.

I may add more sections
in the future when there is more content but for now this is the simplest
system that works. The website is still completely file-based and I can easily
add new content.
