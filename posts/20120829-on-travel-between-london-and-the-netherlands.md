As I have recently found a job in London, the question of how to travel
cheaply and efficiently between London and my parents' house in the
Netherlands becomes a lot more interesting. So far I have always taken a
flight to London and in this article I'm going to outline why I'm taking
the train next time.

The conventional wisdom seems to be that flights operated by cheap airlines
are the way to go. This may be true if you live near an airport (e.g.,
Schiphol Airport, Eindhoven Airport, Rotterdam The Hague Airport) but if
you don't then it turns out the train is worth considering.

Let's consider some examples:

- a flight by KLM, our national airline,
costs a few hundred pounds but you fly into London Heathrow Airport. This
makes for a convenient onward journey as this airport is connected to the Tube.
Unfortunately, the price alone makes me look for alternatives.
- a flight by, e.g., RyanAir or EasyJet is cheap but these airlines fly into
airports further away from the city (e.g., London Gatwick, London Stansted and
London Southend). This means you need to pay for a bus or train to get to
central London. These flights can be cheap but you don't get to choose the
exact time and date: you simply need to fly whenever it happens to be
the cheapest. Furthermore, you need to deal with additional costs if you wish
to fly with checked baggage rather than just hand luggage.

You may be able to find a flight of around 50 euros
(hand luggage only) and the costs to/from the airport can be up to 20 euros
on each side of the border.
Depending on the airport I would also need to take a train and bus to get
there (Eindhoven Airport) rather than just a train (Amsterdam Airport).

Let's say the price sums up to about 100 euros for door-to-door travel.
This looks reasonable but can we travel to London for a similar or better
price and without the restrictions on luggage and times?

It turns out that we can.

We first take the train to Roosendaal and then to Brussels, Belgium. From
there we take the Eurostar train to London St. Pancras station. The price for a single
journey ranges between about 80 euros to 150 euros depending on the travel time.
The cheapest fare I've seen is actually 50 euros (about 40 pounds at the time
of writing) but that does include a delay of eight hours at night in Brussels.

This price is almost door-to-door as it will take a few more stops with
the Tube to get to my destination in London. The price may not differ that much
but, taking everything together, travel by train appears to make for a much
more convenient door-to-door journey (several trains and the Tube versus
several trains, bus, plane, bus/train, Tube). It looks like I'll be
giving the train a try on my next journey to London.

On a final note, it really depends on where you live and where you need to
go. If you happen to live near an airport then I can imagine that a cheap
flight is the best choice.
