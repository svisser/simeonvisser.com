An overview of some of my personal digital projects:

## Photography

You can find my photos on [500px.com](http://500px.com/simeonvisser).

## simeonvisser.com (2010 - )

This website initially ran on a homebuilt file-based content management system
written in PHP using [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

In March 2013 the site was converted to use the Python static site generator
[Nikola](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar) with content written in Markdown
and styled using Bootstrap.

## Palabra (2009 - 2011)

Palabra is a free crossword editor for Ubuntu Linux with a range of features, including
visual editing tools (e.g., grid symmetry options), grid patterns, word lists, clue editing
and export to PDF.

Palabra is a desktop application written in Python and C, using [GTK](http://www.gtk.org/), [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) and [Pango](http://www.pango.org/).

## egdieren.nl (2007 - )

egdieren.nl is a website written from scratch in PHP.
I've developed both the front-end and back-end using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript (mostly [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)). The design of the website
was provided.

## Video game maps and add-ons (2002 - 2007)

I've created various levels and add-ons for video games in several genres, notably
first-person shooters and role-playing games.

This includes the design and development
of the virtual environments using the level editing tools of the games
(e.g., UnrealEd of the [Unreal Engine](http://www.unrealengine.com/)).
Additionally, I've written scripts for interactive in-game events, dialogs and guided cutscenes.

With a few exceptions, all of the content (textures, 2D and 3D models) comes
from the game itself or the game's fan community.
